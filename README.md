Homework Assignment Week 1 - Code Refactor

## Description
```
Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses. It ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Making a website accessible is also good for business for many reasons, one of them being that accessible sites are better positioned in search engines like Google. It also helps companies avoid litigation that can occur when people with disabilities cannot access their website.

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

```

## My Contribution

```
As part of this assignment, I've taken the existing code and refactored it to meet the above laid-out acceptance criteria. Here is my contribution to the code:

- Refactored the title so that it is descriptive and relevant to the webpage.
- Added the meta tags for search engine optimization.
- Refactored the header and footer code so that the elements are HTML semantic.
- Replaced the div tags with main, section, article and aside tags to semantically represent the elements.
- Gave a common class to the elements with the same styling in HTML and the corresponding CSS to get rid of repetitive code. 
- Added the alt attribute to the image elements on the entire page.
- Ensured that all the HTML elements follow a logical structure and are in sequential order.
