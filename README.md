## Acceptance Criteria

```

WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

```

- Added the meta tags for search engine optimization.
- Refactored the header and footer code so that the elements are HTML semantic.
