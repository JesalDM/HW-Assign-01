## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

```
## My Contribution

```
- Refactored the title so that it is descriptive and relevant to the webpage.
- Added the meta tags for search engine optimization.
- Refactored the header and footer code so that the elements are HTML semantic.
- Replaced the div tags with main, section and aside tags to semantically represent the elements.
- Gave a common class to the elements with the same styling in HTML and the corresponding CSS to get rid of repetitive code. 
- Changed the class name of the banner so that it is more appropriate to the context.
- Added the alt attribute to the image elements on the entire page.
- Ensured that all the HTML elements follow a logical structure and are in sequential order.
